# Array-Based Generic Set Implementation

A high-performance C++ implementation of a generic array-based set data structure with advanced sorting capabilities and memory optimization.

## Features

- Template-based implementation with arithmetic type constraints
- Dynamic memory management with automatic resizing
- Multiple sorting algorithms including:
    - Bubble Sort
    - Insertion Sort
    - Selection Sort
    - Bidirectional Bubble Sort
    - Odd-Even Sort

## Key Functionalities

- Efficient element insertion and removal
- Duplicate prevention
- Index-based access
- Search capabilities
- Median calculation
- Performance monitoring for sorting operations

## Performance Optimizations

- Dynamic capacity management - doubles when full, halves when below 25% utilization
- Memory-efficient implementation
- Constant-time access operations

## Requirements

- C++20 or higher
- Standard C++ compiler

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with various scenarios including empty sets, single-element sets, large datasets, and different numeric types.
